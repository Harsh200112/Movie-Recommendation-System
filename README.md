# Movie-Recommendation-System

**Overview :**
For Movie Recommendation System I basically trained 3 models for the recommendation which are Content/Tag based recommendation system, KNN based recommendation system and Collaborative Filtering based recommendation system.

Content/Tag based recommendation system :
Recommendation is done on the basis of Genre and tags of the movies.

KNN based recommendation system :
Recommendation is done on the basis of user rating similarities for movies.	

Collaborative Filtering based recommendation system : 
Recommendation is done on the basis of similarity between users to recommend a movie to a particular user.
